# Git and Github advance

We will learn some advanced concept on git and github like branch, merge, merge conflict, github issue, github project and many more.

At first I created a local repository. With two file called git_github_advance and README.md.
Then created 5 branches named branch1, branch2, branch3, branch4, branch5 containing a individual text file.

Then merge branch4 and branch5 to master.
